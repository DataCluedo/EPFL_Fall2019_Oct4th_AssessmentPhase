    "Officials of a canton A have just received some raw medical data from the health department regarding the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in various cities. Their **goal** is to figure out how to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do so, they first performed a correlational analysis of different data sources available to them from the canton. Some of these officials were particularly interested in the **high positive correlation** that existed between \"incidence of tuberculosis (TB)\" across various cities in the canton (expressed as percentage from 0 to 100), and ``the foul (unpleasant) odors in the city as reported by residents (e.g., those coming from industrial waste, medical waste and other household trash)\" (measured on a scale of 0 to 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to **fulfill their goal of reducing incidence of TB**, these officials brainstormed about the following ideas: \n",
    " \n",
    "A) **Strategy A**: implementing good urban planning techniques focusing on better air-flow manipulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "B) **Strategy B**: launching programs to spray air fresheners with pleasant odors (for e.g., lavender, fruity, BBQ, baked etc) in different areas of the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "C) **Strategy C**: raising awareness regarding good hygiene practices in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "D) **Strategy D**: installing indoor recycling stations to improve waste management in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "E) **Strategy E**:  improving availability of vaccination against TB in medical stores across the city.  \n",
    "\n",
    "F) **Strategy F**: launching programs for chemical treatment of air in different areas of the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separate these strategies for reducing the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) into more appropriate and less/not appropriate categories**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reason with the the **dataset provided to you**, and, the **observations of canton officials about the high positive correlation between incidence of TB and foul odors in the city**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please **mark which strategies** are more or less/not appropriate \n",
    "2. Please provide a brief **reasoning** behind your answer (an explanation of **why** you took certain steps or performed certain calculations to get to the solution)\n",
